Today I want to publish a few simple hints which I have used recently

Check out how  much CPUs' time every VPC uses

```sh
for i in `virsh list| awk 'NR !=2 && NR !=1 {print}'| awk '/runn/ {print $2}'`; do echo $i; virsh  vcpuinfo $i ;done

```

Execute something when the script finds the expected changes


```sh
./install.sh  1> test.txt& # Let's say this script runs in background and write something in test.txt
while [ "$APIP" == "" ];do sleep 10; APIP=`grep 'API Password' test.txt`;done; # this line does nothing until it finds a a pattern
echo "$APIP" | mail -s "API" efimius@gmail.com # sends an email when finds the pattern
```
