# Well, I turned 42.

You know, when I turned 35 or something close. I was thinking about significant results I reached by this time, mostly about career advantages, illnesses, and my family.

I have to assume that I did not feel(think) this way today. I am just curious about my future and thinking that exactly 42 means,  I  did not mean my age, I  meant this strange number 42  the answer to everything.
