# Well, I turned 42.

You know, when I turned 35 or something, I was thinking about significant results I achieved by this time, mostly about career advantages, ~~health~~ illnesses, and my family.

I have to admit that I did not feel(think) this way today. I am just curious about my future and thinking what exactly 42 means,  I  do not mean my age, I  mean this strange number "42",  the answer to everything.
